# Capstone - Google Data Analytics Course
This is the final project (capstone) of the Google Data Analytics certification that group all the key elements seen through the course. A case study is provided, where the fictional company (Cyclistic) needs to answer to a series of key business questions using data. In this imaginary situation, I am part of the marketing analytics team. My goal is to apply all the knowledge acquired in the Google Analytics course to find the answers to the questions posed. The introductory documentation can be read [here](/docs/case_study_definition.md).
